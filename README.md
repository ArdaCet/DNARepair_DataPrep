# DNARepair_DataPrep
This directory was created to put necessary scripts and pipelines which had been developed during my master's thesis project.

#### The python scripts provided within this repository is for after and/or before data preparation of XR-seq, Damage-seq, ChIP-seq and DNase I hypersensitivity Sites (DNase-seq).
#### The bash scrpits are also shared for data preparation.

### The responsibility is not taken by my behalf, if negative and unexpected effects on the data happens after using scripts found at the repository.
Keep in midn that anything uploaded here are particularly developed for specific purposes not for general usage.

## This directory is no longer used. If you need more reliable codes you may want to visit my another repository which is now private but going to be published soon.
